    <p>This package contains various implementations of the {@link
    org.objectweb.wildcat.ContextProvider} interface. Most are "infrastructure"
    providers ({@link EmptyContextProvider}, {@link ExpressionsProvider},
    {@link OverlayContextProvider}) and do not provide data by themselves.</p>
    
    <p>{@link BasicContextProvider} is the default configurable implementation: it
    uses a simple in-memory implementation of resources and attributes, and can
    be entirley manipulated programmatically. It is designed to serves as a basis
    for other providers.</p>
    
    <p>{@link DynamicContextProvider} extends {@link BasicContextProvider} with
    two new features:
    <ol>
    <li>the ability to attach {@link Sampler}s (simple data sources) to resources,
    which will update the resource's attributes automatically according to some
    sampling rate;</li>
    <li>the abililty to define <em>synthetic attributes</em> by an expression
    which can depend on other parts of the context. These attributes will be
    automatically recomputed when on of the locations they depend on changes.</li>
    </ol>
