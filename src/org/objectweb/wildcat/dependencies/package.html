    <p>This package provides some classes to track dependencies between locations
    in a context, event when provided by different {@link ContextProvider}s.</p>
    
    <p>{@link DependencyGraph} and {@link DependencyGraphImpl} is a generic
    implementation of a dependency graph to keep track of who depends on whom.</p>
    
    <p>{@link ExpressionDepencenciesColletor} is an {@link ExpressionVisitor}
    which computes the set of context dependencies (paths) of an expression (be it
    a synthetic attribute definition or a watched expression).</p>
    
    <p>{@link DependencyManager} requests update notifications of context
    locations when it receives an event indicating that one of its
    dependencies has changed.</p>
