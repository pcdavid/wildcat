    <p>This package contains the main WildCAT classes and interfaces, including
    everything needed for basic usage (i.e. not configuration).</p>
    
    <p>The four types which implement the public WildCAT API are:
    <ol>
    <li>{@link Path} (implemented in {@link AbstractPath} and {@link SimplePath}),
    which represents a location or a set of locations in a WildCAT context. Most
    public methods which take a path in argument also have variants which take
    strings and convert them automatically to paths (if possible). Users can also
    create {@link Path}s explicitely using {@link Context#creatPath(String)}.</li>
    <li>{@link ContextListener} defines the different callbacks used to notify
    client when the events they have registered to have occured. There is one
    method call by kind of event. {@link ContextListenerAdapter} provides a
    default, empty, implementation of {@link ContextListener} which can be
    subclassed to override only the methods of interest.</li>
    <li>{@link EventKind} is an enumeration of the different kinds of
    user-level events, each corresponding to one method in {@link ContextListener}.
    This enumeration is used when creating registrations.</li>
    <li>Finally, {@link Context} is the main class: it uses a hierarchical and dynamic
    data model of resources and attributes to represent the context and offers
    APIs to:
    <ol>
    <li>query this context (using paths, including patterns)</li>
    <li>register listeners for events of interests</li>
    <li>configure the content of the context by mounting and unmounting
    the appropriate {@link ContextProvider}s at specific locations, in the
    same way different Unix filesystems can be mounted inside the same, unified
    hierarchy of directories and files.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>
    </ol>
