    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

    <p>WildCAT is a Java toolkit/framework which can be used to build
      context-aware applications. From the client applications point
      of view, it provides a simple and dynamic data model to
      represent the execution context of the application, and offers a
      simple API for the programmers to access this information both
      synchronously and synchronously (<i>pull</i> and <i>push</i>).
      Internally, it is a framework designed to facilitate the
      aggregation of contextual data by integrating existing
      monitoring technologies into a single common model.</p>

    <p>Numerous monitoring solutions already exist in many domains
      (network and grid, performance, application-level, environment,
      etc.). Each represent real expertise in a specialized domain,
      but these solutions can not be easily combined to provide an
      overall picture, as they are generally ad hoc and heterogeneous.
      Building context-aware applications and autonomic control loops
      requires a systemic view of the target application and its
      environment, which covers domains currently targeted by
      different solutions. In order to build such a systemic view
      without re-implementing already existing solutions, one must be
      able to integrate to (called "providers" from now on) in a
      uniform way. In a sense, what is needed is a <em>monitoring
      middleware</em>, able to provide a uniform -- and hopefuly
      simple -- interface to a set of heterogeneous monitoring
      solutions.</p>

    <p>WildCAT provides such a middleware platform, and is built
      around the following requirements:
     <ul>
       <li>First, WildCAT provides a <em>common</em>, <em>generic</em>
	 and <em>flexible</em> data model to represent the monitoring
	 data from all the providers in a single, uniform way to the
	 end user.</li>
       <li>This model is made accessible to client users through an
	 API which supports two modes: a <em>pull mode</em>, where the
	 user queries the middleware to know the current structure and
	 state of the model; and a <em>push mode</em> where the user
	 can ask to be notified automatically and asynchronously of
	 specific conditions occurring in the model. This API is
	 designed to be easy to learn and to use, and to isolate the
	 programmer from the actual implementation details.</li>
       <li>The internal configuration of the middleware, which
	 determines how the different data sources
	 (<em>providers</em>) are configured and integrated, is
	 entirely dynamic and programmable.</li>
       <li>WildCAT tries to impose as little overhead (both
	 in memory and CPU) in the use of the integration
	 framework/middleware compared to a "native" usage of the
	 providers.</li>
     </ul>
    </p>

    <p>WildCAT is designed to take different kinds of users into account,
      each of which has particular needs which influence the system's
      design:
      <ul>
	<li>The client user is an <em>application programmer</em> who
	  wants to make his application context-aware (whether this
	  awareness is hard-coded or managed by an autonomic feedback
	  loop). To this user, WildCAT consists in a simple,
	  hierarchic and dynamic data model which represents his/her
	  application's context, and an easy to use API to access this
	  model.</li>
	<li>The second type of WildCAT user is
	  the <em>configurator</em>, who, given the information
	  required by the application programmer, identifies the data
	  sources which can give access to these information, and
	  organises them into a consistent WildCAT data model. The
	  tools available to the configurator include a generic and
	  configurable implementation of the data model, in which
	  attributes values can be provided directly by external
	  sensors (for example LeWYS probes) and are updated at
	  regular (configurable) intervals. This implementation also
	  supports the notion of synthetic attributes whose value is
	  defined in terms of other attributes in the context and are
	  updated automatically when their dependencies change.</li>
	<li>Finally, the last type of user is the <em>developer</em>
	  who extends the framework itself, by creating adapters for
	  new kinds of data sources (either primitive sensors of
	  structured sources), or by providing tools to help the
	  configurator in his job of modelling the context and
	  integrating heterogeneous sources (for example configuration
	  languages or GUI tools).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 id="model">The data model</h2>

    <p>WildCAT represents the execution context using a purposedly
      simple data model consisting in a tree of <em>resources</em>,
      each described by a set of <em>attributes</em>. The top-level,
      root resource is anonymous and can contain only sub-resources
      (no attributes). Every other resource is identified by a name,
      unique among all the sub-resources of a given parent resource,
      and can contain sub-resources and attributes. Attributes are
      named values attached to a resource they describe, and as for
      resources their names is unique among siblings. However,
      resources and attributes names are in different namespaces, so
      it is possible for a resource to have both a sub-resource and an
      attribute with the same name.</p>

    <p>This model does not impose any particular semantics on the
      structure of resources and attributes. Depending on how the
      model is used, "r2 is a sub-resource of r1" can mean "r2 depends
      on r1", "r2 is a part of r1", "r2 is an aspect of r1", etc.
      WildCAT only provides a base mechanism, and does not impose a
      particular policy on how it should be used. For example, most
      applications map attributes to properties of the corresponding
      resource. This works if properties are atomic, but if one wants
      a more sophisticated modeling of properties (including for
      example the unit of measure, its precision, etc.), one would
      model properties as resources with different attributes for
      different aspects of the properties.</p>

    <p>WildCAT uses a syntax inspired by Unix file names to denote 
      elements in the context while being indenpendent on the actual
      implementation. A <em>path</em> can denote either a resource, an
      attribute, or a set of resources or attributes matching a
      particular pattern.</p>

    <pre>
      /sys/storage/memory              // A specific resource
      /sys/storage/disks/hda#removable // A specific attribute
      /sys/devices/input/*             // All the (direct) sub-resources of input
      /sys/devices/input/mouse#*       // All the attributes of mouse
      /cluster/nodes/*/load#cpu        // The processing loads of all the nodes in a cluster
    </pre>
    
    <p>Note that a path can be syntactically valid but denote a
      location which does not exist.</p>

    <p>Of course, since the context being modeled is highly dynamic,
      so is WildCAT's data model. Each change occuring in the context
      model is represented by an event, which can be observed (other
      kinds of events can also be observed, but they do not strictly
      correspond to primitive changes in the model). The possible
      kinds of events are:
      <ul>
	<li><code>RESOURCE_ADDED</code>
	  and <code>RESOURCE_REMOVED</code>, fired when resources
	  appear or disappear in the context.</li>

	<li><code>ATTRIBUTE_ADDED</code>
	  and <code>ATTRIBUTE_REMOVED</code>, fired when attributes
	  appear or disappear in a resource.</li>

	<li><code>ATTRIBUTE_CHANGED</code>, fired when the value
	  of an attribute changes.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 id="api">User-level APIs</h2>

    <p>The user-level API, which is used by the client programmer, is
      designed to be simple and easy to learn. All the interactions of
      the programmer with WildCAT happen through an instance of
      the <code>Context</code> class (multiple instances can be
      created inside a single application).</p>

    <p>The first set of methods implement synhronous requests
      (<em>pull</em> mode) and allow clients to discover the structure
      of the context and to request the immediate value of an
      attribute:</p>

    <pre>
      Collection&lt;Path&gt; lookup(Path query) { ... }
      Collection&lt;Path&gt; lookup(String query) { ... }
      Object lookupAttribute(Path attr) { ... }
      Object lookupAttribute(String attr) { ... }
    </pre>

    <p>The main methods are <code>lookup(Path)</code>
      and <code>lookupAttribute(Path)</code>, but both provide
      variants taking strings instead of pre-parsed <code>Path</code>s
      for convenience.</p>

    <p><code>lookup(Path)</code> takes an absolute path as a
      parameter, which can be either definite (i.e. representing a
      specific location like <code>/geo/location#latitude</code>) or a
      pattern (i.e. representing of set of potential locations,
      like <code>/sys/devices/*</code>). It returns the paths of all
      the elements currently in the context (resources and attributes)
      which match the query. This method is very generic and
      covers several use cases:</p>

    <pre>
      // Testing whether an element exists in the context
      boolean exists = !context.lookup("/sys/devices/keyboard").isEmpty();

      // Finding all the sub-resources
      Collection&lt;Path&gt; devices = context.lookup("/sys/devices/*");

      // Finding all the attributes of a resource
      Collection&lt;Path&gt; mouseAttrs = context.lookup("/sys/devices/mouse#*");

      // Finding a specific attribute on a set of resources
      Collection&lt;Path&gt; vendors = context.lookup("/sys/devices/*#vendor");

      // Finding all the siblings of a resource
      // See the Path interface for other methods to manipulate paths
      Collection&lt;Path&gt; siblings = context.lookup(aPath.getParent().append("*"));
    </pre>

    <p>The second method, <code>lookupAttribute(Path)</code> takes an
      absolute path (either as a string or a real <code>Path</code>
      object) which must designate a definite attribute (i.e. not a
      pattern), and returns the current value of the attribute in
      question, or <code>null</code> if it does not exist.</p>

    <pre>
      Double load = (Double) context.lookupAttribute("/sys/cpu/load#load_1min");
    </pre>

    <p>The second set of methods provided by <code>Context</code>
      enable a client to be notified asynchronously when some events
      of interest occur (<em>push</em> mode). These methods follow the
      publish/subscribe pattern: the client first registers its
      interest in a kind of event, and from this point on WildCAT will
      send it asynchronous notifications each time a corresponding
      event occurs. The methods in <code>Context</code> corresponding
      to this interface are:</p>
    
    <pre>
    Object register(EnumSet&lt;EventKind&gt; evtKinds, Path path, ContextListener listener) { ... }
    Object registerExpression(EnumSet&lt;EventKind&gt; evtKinds, String expression, ContextListener listener) { ... }
    void unregister(Object cookie) { ... }
    </pre>

    <p>The first method, <code>register()</code> takes a "bitmask"
      representing the kinds of events the client is interested in
      (using the <code>EventKind</code> enumeration), the path on
      which the events must be detected (this path can be a pattern),
      and finally a listener object (which will receive the event
      notifications). For exemple, to get notified each time a new
      input device is plugged or unplugged:</p>

    <pre>
      context.register(EnumSet.of(RESOURCE_ADDED, RESOURCE_REMOVED),
                       Context.createPath("/sys/devices/input/*")), myListener);
    </pre>

    <p>Where <code>myListener</code> implements
      the <code>ContextListener</code> interface:</p>

    <pre>
      public interface ContextListener {
          void attributeAdded(Path attr, long timeStamp);
          void attributeRemoved(Path attr, long timeStamp);
          void attributeChanged(Path attr, Object oldValue, Object newValue, long timeStamp);
          void resourceAdded(Path res, long timeStamp);
          void resourceRemoved(Path res, long timeStamp);
          void expressionValueChanged(Object cookie, Object oldValue, Object newValue, long timeStamp);
          void conditionOccured(Object cookie, long timeStamp);
      }
    </pre>

    <p>The next method, <code>registerExpression()</code>, is used only in
      combination with the <code>EXPRESSION_CHANGED</code>
      and <code>CONDITION_OCCURED</code> event kinds (and the
      corresponding methods in <code>ContextListener</code>). This
      allows clients to register to more complex events. For example,
      if a client only wants to be notified when the room temperature
      goes beyond 30°C, it can use the following code:</p>

    <pre>context.registerExpression(EnumSet.of(CONDITION_OCCURED),
                           "/geo/location/room#temperature > 30",
                           aListener);</pre>

    <p>instead of using a simpler <code>ATTRIBUTE_CHANGED</code> event
      kind, and being notified a many non-intersting events.</p>
    
    <p>An <code>EXPRESSION_CHANGED</code> event occurs each
      time the value of the monitored expression changes. If the
      expression depends on multiple paths, WildCAT will automatically
      recompute its value each time one of these paths
      changes. <code>CONDITION_OCCURED</code> can be seen as a special
      case of <code>EXPRESSION_CHANGED</code> for boolean expressions
      where only the transation from <i>false</i> to <i>true</i> are
      considered.</p>

    <p>The expressions usable with <code>registerExpression()</code> can use
      paths, constant numbers and strings, comparison operators
      (<code>=</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, 
      <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>), arithmetic operations
      (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>,
      with the usual precedence rules), boolean operators
      (<code>not</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>), and
      finally function invocation (<code>function(arg1,
      arg2...)</code>). WildCAT provides some predefined functions
      working on numbers and strings, but new functions can be added
      easily to extend the vocabulary of synthetic expression (this
      feature is probably the best way to extend the power of WildCAT
      without changing its external interface).</p>

    <p>Both <code>register()</code> and <code>registerExpression()</code> return
      an opaque identifier ("cookie") corresponding to this particular
      subscription. This object should be kept by the client, as it
      must be provided to <code>unregister()</code> in order to
      disable an event subscription, and is also used when sending
      notifications to listeners.</p>

    <h2 id="config">Configuration</h2>

    <p>When first created, an instance of <code>Context</code> does
      not contain any resource or attribute. Before it can be used by
      a client as described in the previous section, it must be
      configured. This configuration can be done by the client
      himself, but need not be: pre-configured contexts could be made
      available to users, tailored to particular kinds of applications
      (i.e. desktop applications, application servers, administration
      consoles...).</p>

    <p>In analogy with Unix filesystems, where different filesystems
      implementations can be integrated in a single hierarchy,
      configuring WildCAT is done by <em>mounting</em> (and
      unmounting) <em>context providers</em> at specific locations. A
      context provider is simply a Java object which implements
      the <code>ContextProvider</code> interface (see that interface's
      documentation for more details). As a framework, WildCAT is only
      concerned with the integration of such providers, and not on
      their actual implementation or configuration: each specific
      implementation provides its own configuration mechanism.</p>

    <pre>
      Context ctx = new Context();
      MyProvider p1 = new MyProvider();
      // configure p1
      ctx.mount("/some/location", p1);
      // change p1's configuration
      SomeOtherProvider p2 = new SomeOtherProvider("configuration.file");
      ctx.mount("/another/location", p2);
    </pre>

    <p>However, WildCAT provides nonetheless two flexible and
      configurable implementations of <code>ContextProvider</code>:
      <ul>
	<li><p><code>BasicContextProvider</code> simply implements the
	    data model of resources and attributes as a tree of Java
	    objects in memory. It does not provide any data by itself
	    but is fully controllable by program: its API enable the
	    creation/deletion of resources and attributes, and the
	    modification of attributes value. It is designed to serve
	    as a possible starting point for other
	    implementations.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>DynamicContextProvider</code>
	    extends <code>BasicContextProvider</code> with two features:
	    <ul>
	      <li>the ability to define synthetic attributes, whose
		value is the result of an expression which may involve
		other elements in the context, and is automatically
		recomputed when these dependencies change;</li>
	      <li>the ability to attach <code>sensors</code> to
		resources. Sensors are objects which monitor some part
		of the context on request and return there measures as
		a set of named values, which are then used to update
		the resource's attributes. When a sensor is attached,
		a time period is supplied.
		The <code>DynamicContextProvider</code> will
		automatically request new values from the sensor
		according to this period and update the resource's
		attributes.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="extension">Extension: writing adapters and providers</h2>

    <p>WildCAT distinguishes two kinds of
      extensions: <em>adapters</em> and <em>providers</em>.</p>

    <p>Adapters are simple wrappers for existing sensors, to make them
      usable by <code>DynamicContextProvider</code>. There are used
      when the existing monitoring technology to integrate has a
      simple, non-structured data model. For example, an adapter
      exists for LeWYS probes (not included in the default
      distribution), as these probes provide their data using a simple
      model and are independent of each others.</p>

    <p>Providers are more complex: they provide a full implementation
      of the <code>ContextProvider</code> interface (maybe using one
      of the existing implementation as a basis). They are used when
      the technology to intergrate already provides a structured data
      model
      (e.g. <a
      href="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fhal">HAL</a>).</p>

    <p>The default WildCAT distribution does not include any adapter
      or provider (except for an
      example <code>FileSystemProvider</code>) in ordre to keep its
      dependencies minimal. Several already exist or are in the work
      however, and will be distributed separately as extensions
      when they mature.</p>
