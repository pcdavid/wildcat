    <p>This package defines the internal events used by WildCAT to
    track changes in the context. These events are slightly different
    from the ones used for user-level notifications: user-level event
    notifications are represented by method calls to the different
    methods defined in {@link org.objectweb.wildcat.ContextListener
    ContextListener}, while internal events are reified as objects, so
    that they can be manipulated (buffered, logged, passed to
      different threads, etc.) more easily.</p>

    <p>Three kinds of events are defined:
    <ol>
      <li>path creation ({@link PathCreatedEvent}) indicate that a new
      resource or attribute has appeared in the context;</li>
      <li>path removal ({@link PathRemovedEvent}) indicate that a resource
      or attribute has disappeared from the context;</li>
      <li>path change ({@link PathChangedEvent}) indicate that the value
      of an attribute has changed.</li>
    </ol>
    These three classes inherit from {@link PathEvent} which provides two attributes
    common to all event kinds:
    <ul>
    <li>the <em>path</em> at which the event occured;</li>
    <li>a <em>timestamp</em> indicating when the event occurred.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>Classes which want to be notified of event must implement the {@link EventListener}
    interface.</p>
    
    <p>This package also provides some utilities to deal with these events:
    <ul>
    <li>{@link EventBuffer} is a listener which stores the events it receives for later
    (possibly asynchronous) processing.</li>
    <li>{@link EventSource} can be subclassed by classes which generate events to send
    them to a listener.</li>
    <li>{@link EventForwarder} is both an {@link EventListener} and an {@link EventSource},
    i.e; it forwards all the event notifications it receives to its own listener.</li>
    <li>{@link EventMultiplexer} is an {@link EventListener} which broadcasts all the
    events it receives to a dynamically configurable set of target listeners (1-to-many
    event multiplexer).<li>
    </ul>
    </p>
